# TravelApp v0.0.1 

[LIVE DEMO](http://limitless-peak-7667.herokuapp.com) - *This may or may not be available depending on the Expedia's API availability*

This application is an information centre about hotels for travelers; It was built by [yours truly](http://github.com/joaolucasl) as an assignment for the [CAB432 Cloud Computing](https://www.qut.edu.au/study/unit-search/unit?unitCode=CAB432&idunit=53779) unit at [QUT](qut.edu.au) during the Semester 2 of 2015. (Please bear in mind it was my first Javascript project EVER, it is here for historical purposes only)
### The Assignment
The idea of this assignment was working with different APIs and making something meaningful/useful with that mashup, as well as deploying it using cloud servers and Docker containers. I chose to work upon travel-related and location based APIs to build this application;
### API data
I don't own any of the data served by this application neither hold any responsability for any content that may not be specially accurate. This application was built under educational purposes and isn't meant to inflict any copyright law either.

## How to use
The code is in the same state as it was at the time of the submission, in the sense that I didn't have time to round every edge of it. You may face some issues or even unhandled expections and errors (Sorry about that). 
If you still wish to test it, you must have *NodeJS 0.12* installed, since it was built upon it (I haven't tested it with other versions yet). Go to the application directory on your machine and run:

`npm install`

That will install the necessary dependencies, so that you may run `npm start`. If everything goes well (and the Expedia API is available) the application should be available at `localhost:5000`
